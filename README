About bacula-web

This is my little contribution to the bacula community and the best backup software (http://www.bacula.org).

Bacula-web was firstly developed by Juan-Luis Frances and I'm just looking forward to support and develop this project.

You should find more informations on the project page at bacula-web.dflc.ch

Thank you for using bacula-web
