Versions numbering
==================

*Releases prior 6.0.0*

Bacula-Web version follow Bacula numbering (see example below)

============== ================== 
Bacula version Bacula-Web version 
============== ==================
5.2.13         5.2.13-1
5.2.13         5.2.13-2
5.2.13         5.2.13-3
============== ==================

*Since release 6.0.0*

Why changing release numbering ?

First, to make my developper "life" easier ;)
And to identify clearly which release is major, minor or a maintenance/bug fix release

As of version 6.0.0, each Bacula-Web releases will be composed of three digits (see below)

   * first: major release (major new features)
   * second: minor release (minor new features)
   * third: maintenance and/or bug fix release

For example: Release 6.0.0 (released on November 11th 2013
